# Linear-Multivariate-Regression-Analysis

## TASK 1

- The mean and variance of all 4 independent variables, X1, X2, X3, X4, and, X5, and of the dependent variable Y are calculated. 
- Their histograms are also plotted to check if they follow normal distribution.

- The inter-quartile range scores (IQR scores) of all variables are used to obtain outliers. 
- Post this, outliers are removed from the main dataframe. 
- After the outlier removal, the dimensions of the dataframe are modified from 300x6 to 275x6. 

# TASK 2

- A simple linear regression is carried out to estimate the parameters of the model:
Y = a0 + a1X1 + Îµ.

- The estimates of coefficients were calculated using statsmodels package. The estimated values of coefficients are shown in the figure below.
